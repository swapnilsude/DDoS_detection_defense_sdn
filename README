Copy contents of this folder to ~/pox/ext

Test simulation:

------------ ENTROPY -------------
1) Running the controller with entropy solution implemented:
	sudo ~/pox/pox.py l3_learning_entropy

2) Creating a mininet topology:
	sudo mn --topo tree,depth=3,fanout=4 --controller=remote

3) Running traffic:
	mininet>xterm h1 h2 h3
	On h1 run Normal traffic using:
		python pox/ext/traffic.py –s 2 –e 65
	After completion of execution of above, repeat the same on h1 again.
	On h2 and h3 run DDoS attack targeted towards h64 using:
		python pox/ext/traffic-gen/attack.py 10.0.0.64

--------- SVM ------------
1) Running the controller with entropy solution implemented:
        sudo ~/pox/pox.py l3_learn_svm

Repeat step 2 and 3 from entropy.

Steps to generate data:

1) Run step 1(with any of default controller included with pox eg. l3_learning),2.z  
2) Run:
	sudo tshark -i s1-eth1 -f 'icmp or udp or tcp' -T fields -E separator=, -e col.Time -e ip.addr -e ip.proto -e ip.ttl> test.csv
	(use a any interface from where all data will flow, choosing any interface may include the loopback)
3) Run normal and DDoS traffic as mentioned in step 3 of entropy.
4) Include the output test file path from above command and add it in script svm_data_gen/svm-gen-data.py and Run
	python svm-gen-data.py
   to create a data file for SVM.
